## Introduction
GitHub is a web-based open-source version control software that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. In the world of software development, developers and users utilize GitHub as an issue tracker and code collaboration tool. It is critically important to understand that software development is very hard to achieve unless there is communication amongst developers. 

We can clearly see that communication and collaboration across developers improve the productivity of software developers within an open-source software medium. Therefore, it is important to collectively analyze the influence of software development procedures in terms of productivity as well as the size of software developer groups because industries analyze their productivity with their analytical skills and their performance metrics.

The goal of this paper is to investigate the correlation between shared development and productivity on Github. Specifically, we want to find the critical features that are correlated with communication across developers and influence the issue closure latency.


## Research Questions and Hypothesis
- **Research Question I**: In general, we know that having more people work on development can improve productivity. Hence, we want to discover whether in open source software development: With a larger software development team (more developers working on the same project), is there effectively a lower issue closure latency in open source projects? 

- **Research Question II**: In terms of one project’s productivity, would the presence of an increased number of shared developers reduce the issue closure latency? For the research purpose of this project, we consider shared developers as those developers who have contributed to multiple projects other than the current working project during the current project’s age time frame. 

- **Research Question III**: Inspired by the paper [2], we are interested in whether the project’s average latency of issue closure time can be reduced due to having developers that communicate knowledge across projects in terms of sharing knowledge?   We consider this since we strongly possess a conviction that working on multiple projects would facilitate the transfer of knowledge across developers and hence would improve the productivity of a software development team.

- **Hypothesis I**: An increase in the number team size can lead to lower latency in resolving issues

- **Hypothesis II**: An increase in the number of shared developers indicates more communication and collaboration between them which leads to lower latency in resolving issues

- **Hypothesis III**: The project’s average latency of issue closure time can be reduced due to having developers that communicate knowledge across projects in terms of sharing knowledge.

Based on the research questions, we attempt to validate our hypothesis on the role of communication during software development.
