# This script allows to crawl information and repositories from
# GitHub using the GitHub REST API (https://developer.github.com/v3/search/).
#
# Given a query, the script downloads for each repository returned by the query its ZIP file.
# In addition, it also generates a CSV file containing the list of repositories queried.
# For each query, GitHub returns a json file which is processed by this script to get information
# about repositories.
#
# The GitHub API limits the queries to get 100 elements per page and up to 1,000 elements in total.
# To get more than 1,000 elements, the main query should be splitted in multiple subqueries
# using different time windows through the constant SUBQUERIES (it is a list of subqueries).
#
# As example, constant values are set to get the repositories on GitHub of the user 'rsain'.
